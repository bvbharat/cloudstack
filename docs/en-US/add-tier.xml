  <title>Adding Tiers</title>
  <para>Tiers are distinct locations within a VPC that act as isolated networks, which do not have
    access to other tiers by default. Tiers are set up on different VLANs that can communicate with
    each other by using a virtual router. Tiers provide inexpensive, low latency network
    connectivity to other tiers within the VPC.</para>
