        <listitem><para>A layer-3 switching layer is at the core of the data center. A router redundancy protocol like VRRP should be deployed. Typically high-end core switches also include firewall modules. Separate firewall appliances may also be used if the layer-3 switch does not have integrated firewall capabilities. The firewalls are configured in NAT mode. The firewalls provide the following functions:</para>

	        <listitem><para>When the cloud spans multiple zones, the firewalls should enable site-to-site VPN such that servers in different zones can directly reach each other.</para></listitem>

        <listitem><para>A layer-2 access switch layer is established for each pod. Multiple switches can be stacked to increase port count. In either case, redundant pairs of layer-2 switches should be deployed.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>The Management Server cluster (including front-end load balancers, Management Server nodes, and the MySQL database) is connected to the management network through a pair of load balancers.</para></listitem>

        <listitem><para>Each pod contains storage and computing servers. Each storage and computing server should have redundant NICs connected to separate layer-2 access switches.</para></listitem>
