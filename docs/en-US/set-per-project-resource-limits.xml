  <title>Setting Per-Project Resource Limits</title>
  <para>The &PRODUCT; root administrator or the domain administrator of the domain where the project
    resides can set new resource limits for an individual project. The project owner can set
    resource limits only if the owner is also a domain or root administrator.</para>
  <para>The new limits must be below the global default limits set by the &PRODUCT; administrator
    (as described in <xref linkend="set-resource-limits-for-projects"/>). If the project already
    owns more of a given type of resource than the new maximum, the resources are not affected;
    however, the project can not add any new resources of that type until the total drops below the
    new limit.</para>
