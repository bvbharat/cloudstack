  <para>The first step in installation, whether you are installing the Management Server on one host
    or many, is to install the software on a single node. </para>

    <para>If you are planning to install the Management Server on multiple nodes for high
      availability, do not proceed to the additional nodes yet. That step will come later.</para>
  </note>
