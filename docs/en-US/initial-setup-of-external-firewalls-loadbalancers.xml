    <para>When the first VM is created for a new account, &PRODUCT; programs the external firewall and load balancer to work with the VM. The following objects are created on the firewall:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>A new logical interface to connect to the account's private VLAN. The interface IP is always the first IP of the account's private subnet (e.g. 10.1.1.1). </para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>A source NAT rule that forwards all outgoing traffic from the account's private VLAN to the public Internet, using the account's public IP address as the source address</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>A firewall filter counter that measures the number of bytes of outgoing traffic for the account</para></listitem>

    <para>The following objects are created on the load balancer:</para>
    <itemizedlist>        
        <listitem><para>A new VLAN that matches the account's provisioned Zone VLAN</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>A self IP for the VLAN. This is always the second IP of the account's private subnet (e.g. 10.1.1.2).</para></listitem>
