    <title>User Data and Meta Data</title>
    <para>&PRODUCT; provides API access to attach user data to a deployed VM. Deployed VMs also have access to instance metadata via the virtual router.</para>
    <para>User data can be accessed once the IP address of the virtual router is known. Once the IP address is known, use the following steps to access the user data:</para>
    <orderedlist>
        <listitem><para>Run the following command to find the virtual router.</para>
            <programlisting># cat /var/lib/dhclient/dhclient-eth0.leases | grep dhcp-server-identifier | tail -1</programlisting>
        </listitem>
        <listitem><para>Access user data by running the following command using the result of the above command</para><programlisting># curl http://10.1.1.1/latest/user-data</programlisting></listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    <para>Meta Data can be accessed similarly, using a URL of the form http://10.1.1.1/latest/meta-data/{metadata type}. (For backwards compatibility, the previous URL http://10.1.1.1/latest/{metadata type} is also supported.) For metadata type, use one of the following:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>service-offering. A description of the VMs service offering</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>availability-zone. The Zone name</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>local-ipv4. The guest IP of the VM</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>local-hostname. The hostname of the VM</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>public-ipv4. The first public IP for the router. (E.g. the first IP of eth2)</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>public-hostname. This is the same as public-ipv4</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>instance-id. The instance name of the VM</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
