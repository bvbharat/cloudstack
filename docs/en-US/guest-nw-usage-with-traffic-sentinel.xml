  <title>Guest Network Usage Integration for Traffic Sentinel</title>
  <para>To collect usage data for a guest network, &PRODUCT; needs to pull the data from an external
    network statistics collector installed on the network. Metering statistics for guest networks
    are available through &PRODUCT;’s integration with inMon Traffic Sentinel.</para>
  <para>Traffic Sentinel is a network traffic usage data collection package. &PRODUCT; can feed
    statistics from Traffic Sentinel into its own usage records, providing a basis for billing users
    of cloud infrastructure. Traffic Sentinel uses the traffic monitoring protocol sFlow. Routers
    and switches generate sFlow records and provide them for collection by Traffic Sentinel, then
    &PRODUCT; queries the Traffic Sentinel database to obtain this information</para>
  <para>To construct the query, &PRODUCT; determines what guest IPs were in use during the current
    query interval. This includes both newly assigned IPs and IPs that were assigned in a previous
    time period and continued to be in use. &PRODUCT; queries Traffic Sentinel for network
    statistics that apply to these IPs during the time period they remained allocated in &PRODUCT;.
    The returned data is correlated with the customer account that owned each IP and the timestamps
    when IPs were assigned and released in order to create billable metering records in &PRODUCT;.
    When the Usage Server runs, it collects this data.</para>
  <para>To set up the integration between &PRODUCT; and Traffic Sentinel:</para>
  <orderedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>On your network infrastructure, install Traffic Sentinel and configure it to gather
        traffic data. For installation and configuration steps, see inMon documentation at <ulink
          url="http://inmon.com.">Traffic Sentinel Documentation</ulink>.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>In the Traffic Sentinel UI, configure Traffic Sentinel to accept script querying from
        guest users. &PRODUCT; will be the guest user performing the remote queries to gather
        network usage for one or more IP addresses.</para>
      <para>Click File > Users > Access Control > Reports Query, then select Guest from the
        drop-down list.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>On &PRODUCT;, add the Traffic Sentinel host by calling the &PRODUCT; API command
        addTrafficMonitor. Pass in the URL of the Traffic Sentinel as protocol + host + port
        (optional); for example, http://10.147.28.100:8080. For the addTrafficMonitor command
        syntax, see the API Reference at <ulink
          url="http://incubator.apache.org/cloudstack/docs/api/index.html">API
        Documentation</ulink>.</para>
      <para>For information about how to call the &PRODUCT; API, see the Developer’s Guide at
          <ulink
