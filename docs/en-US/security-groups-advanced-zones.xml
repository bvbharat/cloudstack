    <title>Security Groups in Advanced Zones (KVM Only)</title>
        <para>&PRODUCT; provides the ability to use security groups to provide isolation between
            guests on a single shared, zone-wide network in an advanced zone where KVM is the
            hypervisor. Using security groups in advanced zones rather than multiple VLANs allows a greater range
            of options for setting up guest isolation in a cloud.</para>
