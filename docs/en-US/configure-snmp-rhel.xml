  <title>Configuring SNMP Community String on a RHEL Server</title>
  <para>The SNMP Community string is similar to a user id or password that provides access to a
    network device, such as router. This string is sent along with all SNMP requests. If the
    community string is correct, the device responds with the requested information. If the
    community string is incorrect, the device discards the request and does not respond.</para>
  <para>The NetScaler device uses SNMP to communicate with the VMs. You must install SNMP and
    configure SNMP Community string for a secure communication between the NetScaler device and the
    RHEL machine.</para>
