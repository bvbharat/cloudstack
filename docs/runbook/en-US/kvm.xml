<chapter id="chap-Runbook-KVM">
  <title>KVM Setup and installation</title>
  <para>
    KVM is the hypervisor we'll be using - we will recover the initial setup
    which has already been done on the hypervisor host and cover installation
    of the agent software, you can use the same steps to add additional KVM 
    nodes to your CloudStack environment. 
  </para>
  <section id="sect-Runbook-KVM-Prerequisites">
    <title>Prerequisites</title>
    <para>
      We explicitly are using the management server as a compute node as well, 
      which means that we have already performed many of the prerequisite steps
      when setting up the management server, but we will list them here for
      clarity. Those steps are:
      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            <xref linkend="sect-Runbook-Environment-operatingsys-network" />
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            <xref linkend="sect-Runbook-Environment-operatingsys-hostname" />
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            <xref linkend="sect-Runbook-Environment-operatingsys-selinux" />
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            <xref linkend="sect-Runbook-Environment-operatingsys-ntp" />
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
    </para>
    <para>
      You shouldn't need to do that for the management server, of course, but
      any additional hosts will need for you to complete the above steps. 
    </para>
  </section>
    
  <section id="sect-Runbook-KVM-Installation">
    <title>Installation</title>
    <para>
      You'll need to ensure that you are in the directory that was created when 
      we extracted the the tarball. 
      <xref linkend="sect-Runbook-Management-extraction" />
    </para>
    <para>
      You'll be running <filename>./install.sh</filename> again and this time
      choosing <option>A</option> which will install the software necessary for
      managing a KVM node. 
    </para>
  </section>
  <section id="sect-Runbook-KVM-Configuration">
    <title>KVM Configuration</title>
    <para>
      KVM configuration is relatively simple at only a single item. We need to 
      edit the QEMU VNC configuration. This is done by editing 
      <filename>/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf</filename> and ensuring the following 
      line is present and uncommented.
      <screen>vnc_listen=0.0.0.0</screen>
    </para>
    <para>
      You can now just restart the libvirt daemon by issuing the following command:
      <screen><prompt># </prompt><userinput><command>service</command> libvirt restart</userinput></screen>
    </para>
    <para>
      That concludes our installation and configuration of KVM, and we'll now move to using the CloudStack UI
      for the actual configuration of our cloud. 
    </para>
