  <title>Setting Resource Limits for Projects</title>
  <para>The &PRODUCT; administrator can set global default limits to control the amount of resources
    that can be owned by each project in the cloud. This serves to prevent uncontrolled usage of
    resources such as snapshots, IP addresses, and virtual machine instances. Domain administrators
    can override these resource limits for individual projects with their domains, as long as the
    new limits are below the global defaults set by the &PRODUCT; root administrator. The root
    administrator can also set lower resource limits for any project in the cloud</para>
