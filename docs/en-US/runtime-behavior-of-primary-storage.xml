    <title>Runtime Behavior of Primary Storage</title>
    <para>Root volumes are created automatically when a virtual machine is created. Root volumes are deleted when the VM is destroyed. Data volumes can be created and dynamically attached to VMs. <!-- (although, when the Oracle VM hypervisor is used, the VM must be stopped before an additional volume can be attached)--> Data volumes are not deleted when VMs are destroyed.</para>
    <para>Administrators should monitor the capacity of primary storage devices and add additional primary storage as needed.  See the Advanced Installation Guide.</para>            
    <para>Administrators add primary storage to the system by creating a &PRODUCT; storage pool. Each storage pool is associated with a cluster.</para>
