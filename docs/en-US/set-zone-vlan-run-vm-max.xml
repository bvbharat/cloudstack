  <title>Setting Zone VLAN and Running VM Maximums</title>
  <para>In the external networking case, every VM in a zone must have a unique guest IP address.
    There are two variables that you need to consider in determining how to configure &PRODUCT;
    to support this: how many Zone VLANs do you expect to have and how many VMs do you expect to
    have running in the Zone at any one time.</para>
  <para>Use the following table to determine how to configure &PRODUCT; for your
    deployment.</para>
