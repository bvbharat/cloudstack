    <title>Load Balancer Rules</title>
    <para>A &PRODUCT; user or administrator may create load balancing rules that balance traffic received at a public IP to one or more VMs. A user creates a rule, specifies an algorithm, and assigns the rule to a set of VMs.</para>
    <note><para>If you create load balancing rules while using a network service offering that includes an external load balancer device such as NetScaler, and later change the network service offering to one that uses the &PRODUCT; virtual router, you must create a firewall rule on the virtual router for each of your existing load balancing rules so that they continue to function.</para></note>
