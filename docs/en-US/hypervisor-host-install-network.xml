<section id="hypervisor-host-install-network">
    <title>Configure the network bridges</title>
    <warning><para>This is a very important section, please make sure you read this thoroughly.</para></warning>
    <note><para>This section details how to configure bridges using the native implementation in Linux. Please refer to the next section if you intend to use OpenVswitch</para></note>
    <para>In order to forward traffic to your instances you will need at least two bridges: <emphasis>public</emphasis> and <emphasis>private</emphasis>.</para>
    <para>By default these bridges are called <emphasis>cloudbr0</emphasis> and <emphasis>cloudbr1</emphasis>, but you do have to make sure they are available on each hypervisor.</para>
    <para>The most important factor is that you keep the configuration consistent on all your hypervisors.</para>
    <section id="hypervisor-host-install-network-vlan">
        <title>Network example</title>
        <para>There are many ways to configure your network. In the Basic networking mode you should have two (V)LAN's, one for your private network and one for the public network.</para>
        <para>We assume that the hypervisor has one NIC (eth0) with three tagged VLAN's:</para>
        <orderedlist>
            <listitem><para>VLAN 100 for management of the hypervisor</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>VLAN 200 for public network of the instances (cloudbr0)</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>VLAN 300 for private network of the instances (cloudbr1)</para></listitem>
        </orderedlist>
        <para>On VLAN 100 we give the Hypervisor the IP-Address 192.168.42.11/24 with the gateway 192.168.42.1</para>
        <note><para>The Hypervisor and Management server don't have to be in the same subnet!</para></note>

    <section id="hypervisor-host-install-network-configure">
        <title>Configuring the network bridges</title>
        <para>It depends on the distribution you are using how to configure these, below you'll find examples for RHEL/CentOS and Ubuntu.</para>
        <note><para>The goal is to have two bridges called 'cloudbr0' and 'cloudbr1' after this section. This should be used as a guideline only. The exact configuration will depend on your network layout.</para></note>

            <title>Configure in RHEL or CentOS</title>
            <para>The required packages were installed when libvirt was installed, we can proceed to configuring the network.</para>
            <para>First we configure eth0</para>
