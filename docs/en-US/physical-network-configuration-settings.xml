    <title>Configurable Characteristics of Physical Networks</title>
    <para>&PRODUCT; provides configuration settings you can use to set up a physical network in a zone, including:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>What type of network traffic it carries (guest, public, management, storage)</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>VLANs</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Unique name that the hypervisor can use to find that particular network</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Enabled or disabled. When a network is first set up, it is disabled â€“ not in use yet. The administrator sets the physical network to enabled, and it begins to be used. The administrator can later disable the network again, which prevents any new virtual networks from being created on that physical network; the existing network traffic continues even though the state is disabled.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Speed</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Tags, so network offerings can be matched to physical networks</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Isolation method</para></listitem>
