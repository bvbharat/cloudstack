            is not overlapped with the VPC’s CIDR, or another guest CIDR. The CIDR must be
            RFC1918-compliant.</para>

          <para><emphasis role="bold">IPsec Preshared Key</emphasis>: Preshared keying is a method
            where the endpoints of the VPN share a secret key. This key value is used to
            authenticate the customer gateway and the VPC VPN gateway to each other. </para>
          <note>
            <para>The IKE peers (VPN end points) authenticate each other by computing and sending a
              keyed hash of data that includes the Preshared key. If the receiving peer is able to
              create the same hash independently by using its Preshared key, it knows that both
              peers must share the same secret, thus authenticating the customer gateway.</para>

            3DES. Authentication is accomplished through the Preshared Keys.</para>
          <note>
            <para>The phase-1 is the first phase in the IKE process. In this initial negotiation
              phase, the two VPN endpoints agree on the methods to be used to provide security for
              the underlying IP traffic. The phase-1 authenticates the two VPN gateways to each
              other, by confirming that the remote gateway has a matching Preshared Key.</para>

            allows two parties to establish a shared secret over an insecure communications channel.
            The 1536-bit Diffie-Hellman group is used within IKE to establish session keys. The
            supported options are None, Group-5 (1536-bit) and Group-2 (1024-bit).</para>

            AES256, and 3DES.</para>
          <note>
            <para>The phase-2 is the second phase in the IKE process. The purpose of IKE phase-2 is
              to negotiate IPSec security associations (SA) to set up the IPSec tunnel. In phase-2,
              new keying material is extracted from the Diffie-Hellman key exchange in phase-1, to
              provide session keys to use in protecting the VPN data flow.</para>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Perfect Forward Secrecy</emphasis>: Perfect Forward Secrecy
            (or PFS) is the property that ensures that a session key derived from a set of long-term
            public and private keys will not be compromised. This property enforces a new
            Diffie-Hellman key exchange. It provides the keying material that has greater key
            material life and thereby greater resistance to cryptographic attacks. The available
            options are None, Group-5 (1536-bit) and Group-2 (1024-bit). The security of the key
            exchanges increase as the DH groups grow larger, as does the time of the
            exchanges.</para>
          <note>
            <para>When PFS is turned on, for every negotiation of a new phase-2 SA the two gateways
              must generate a new set of phase-1 keys. This adds an extra layer of protection that
              PFS adds, which ensures if the phase-2 SA’s have expired, the keys used for new
              phase-2 SA’s have not been generated from the current phase-1 keying material.</para>
