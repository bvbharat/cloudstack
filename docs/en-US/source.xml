<chapter id="sect-source">
    <title>Building from Source</title>
    <para>The official &PRODUCT; release is always in source code form. While there may
        exist convenience binaries in various forms from a number of places, the
        source is the canonical release will be source. In this document we'll cover 
        acquiring the source release, building that into binary, deployable packages.
    </para>
    <para>
       While building and deploying directly from source is certainly possible, the reality
       of Infrastructure-as-a-Service cloud computing implies a need to deploy packages on
       a potentially large number of systems, which RPMs and DEBs fill nicely.
    </para>
    <para>
       Building and deploying directly from source is thus outside the scope of this
       document, but is documented in the INSTALL.md file in the release.
