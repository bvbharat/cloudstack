  <title>Acquiring a New IP Address for a VPC</title>
  <para>When you acquire an IP address, all IP addresses are allocated to VPC, not to the guest
    networks within the VPC. The IPs are associated to the guest network only when the first
    port-forwarding, load balancing, or Static NAT rule is created for the IP or the network. IP
    can't be associated to more than one network at a time.</para>

      <para>You are prompted for confirmation because, typically, IP addresses are a limited
        resource. Within a few moments, the new IP address should appear with the state Allocated.
        You can now use the IP address in port forwarding, load balancing, and static NAT
        rules.</para>
