This document describes how to develop, build, package and install Apache CloudStack
(Incubating). For more information please refer to the project's website:

    http://incubator.apache.org/cloudstack

Apache CloudStack developers use various platforms for development, this guide
was tested against a CentOS 6.2 x86_64 setup.

Refer to the [wiki](http://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/Index)
for the latest information, especially:

  - [Setting up development environment](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/Setting+up+CloudStack+Development+Environment) for Apache CloudStack.
  - [Building](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/Building) Apache CloudStack.

## Setting up Development Environment

### Installing Tools and Dependencies

Install tools and dependencies used for development:

    $ yum install git ant ant-devel java-1.6.0-openjdk java-1.6.0-openjdk-devel
    mysql mysql-server tomcat6 mkisofs gcc python MySQL-python openssh-clients wget

Set up Maven (3.0.4):

    $ wget http://www.us.apache.org/dist/maven/maven-3/3.0.4/binaries/apache-maven-3.0.4-bin.tar.gz
    $ cd /usr/local/ # or any path
    $ tar -zxvf apache-maven-3.0.4-bin.tar.gz
    $ echo export M2_HOME=/usr/local/apache-maven-3.0.4 >> ~/.bashrc # or .zshrc or .profile
    $ echo export PATH=${M2_HOME}/bin:${PATH} >> ~/.bashrc # or .zshrc or .profile

Note: Tomcat 6.0.35 has some known issue with Apache CloudStack, please use Tomcat
6.0.33 from http://archive.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-6/v6.0.33/bin

### Configure Environment

Set CATALINA_HOME to path where you extract/install tomcat, put them in your
.bashrc or .zshrc or .profile:

    $ echo export CATALINA_HOME=/usr/share/tomcat6/ >> ~/.bashrc

Fix permissions on CATALINA_HOME:

    $ chown -R <you>:<your-group> $CATALINA_HOME

Generate you ssh keys, useful for ssh-ing to your hosts and vm etc.:

    $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -q

Apache CloudStack uses some ports, make sure at least those used by the management
server are available and not blocked by any local firewall. Following ports are
used by Apache CloudStack and its entities:

    8787: Apache CloudStack (Tomcat) debug socket
    9090, 8250: Apache CloudStack Management Server, User/Client API
    8096: User/Client to CloudStack Management Server (unauthenticated)
    3306: MySQL Server
    3922, 8250, 80/443, 111/2049, 53: Secondary Storage VM
    3922, 8250, 53: Console Proxy VM
    3922, 8250, 53: Virtual Router
    22, 80, 443: XenServer, XAPI
    22: KVM
    443: vCenter
    DNS: 53
    NFS: 111/2049

### Configuring MySQL Server

Start the MySQL service:

    $ service mysqld start

### Getting the Source Code

You may get the source code from the repository hosted on Apache:

    $ git clone https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-cloudstack.git

Or, you may fork a repository from the official Apache CloudStack mirror by
Apache on [Github](https://github.com/apache/incubator-cloudstack)

To keep yourself updated on a branch, do:

    $ git pull <origin> <branch>

For example, for master:

    $ git pull origin master

## Building


Clean and build:

    $ mvn clean
    $ mvn install

In case you want support for VMWare, SRX and other non-Apache (referred to as nonoss)
compliant libs, you may download the following jar artifacts from respective vendors:

     deps/cloud-iControl.jar
     deps/cloud-manageontap.jar
     deps/cloud-netscaler-sdx.jar
     deps/cloud-netscaler.jar
     deps/vmware-apputils.jar
     deps/vmware-vim.jar
     deps/vmware-vim25.jar

Install them to ~/.m2 so maven can get them as dependencies:

    $ cd deps
    $ ./install-non-oss.sh

And build them with the nonoss flag:

    $ mvn install -Dnonoss

Clear old database (if any) and deploy the database schema:

    $ mvn -P developer -pl developer -Ddeploydb

Export the following variable if you need to run and debug the management server:

    $ export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx1024m -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=8787,server=y,suspend=n"

Start the management server:

    $ mvn -pl :cloud-client-ui jetty:run

If this works, you've successfully setup a single server Apache CloudStack installation.

Open the following URL on your browser to access the Management Server UI:

    http://localhost:8080/client/

Or,

    http://management-server-ip-address:8080/client

The default credentials are; user: admin, password: password and the domain
field should be left blank which is defaulted to the ROOT domain.

If you want to contribute your changes, send your [git formatted patch](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/Git) to:
https://reviews.apache.org/groups/cloudstack or contact on the developer mailing list.

## Packaging and Installation

Before packaging, please make sure you go through the "Building" section above.
This section describes packaging and installation.

### Debian/Ubuntu

To create debs:

    $ mvn -P deps # -D nonoss, for nonoss as described in the "Building" section above
    $ dpkg-buildpackage

All the deb packages will be created in ../$PWD

To create an apt repo: (assuming appropriate user privileges)

    $ path=/path/to/your/webserver/cloudstack
    $ mv ../*.deb $path
    $ dpkg-scanpackages $path /dev/null | gzip -9c > $path/Packages.gz

Configure your system to use your new apt repo:

    $ echo "deb $path ./" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cloudstack.list

Installation:

Install needed packages, apt-get upgrade for upgrading:

    $ apt-get update
    $ apt-get install cloud-client                   # management server
    $ apt-get install mysql-server                   # mysql server
    $ apt-get install cloud-agent cloud-system-iso   # agent (kvm)
    $ apt-get install cloud-awsapi                   # awsapi server
    $ apt-get install cloud-usage                    # usage server

### RHEL/CentOS

To create rpms:

    $ mvn -P deps # -D nonoss, for nonoss as described in the "Building" section above
    $ ./waf rpm

All the rpm packages will be create in artifacts/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64

To create a yum repo: (assuming appropriate user privileges)

    $ path=/path/to/your/webserver/cloudstack
    $ cd artifacts/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64
    $ mv *.rpm $path
    $ createrepo $path

Configure your system to use your new yum repo, add the following to /etc/yum.repos.d/cloudstack.repo:

    [apache-cloudstack]
    name=Apache CloudStack
    baseurl=http://webserver.tld/path/to/repo
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=0

Installation:

Install needed packages:

    $ yum update
    $ yum install cloud-client                       # management server
    $ yum install mysql-server                       # mysql server
    $ yum install cloud-agent                        # agent (kvm)
    $ yum install cloud-usage                        # usage server

## Notes

If you will be using Xen as your hypervisor, please download [vhd-util](http://download.cloud.com.s3.amazonaws.com/tools/vhd-util)

If management server is installed on RHEL/CentOS, then copy vhd-util into:
/usr/lib64/cloud/common/scripts/vm/hypervisor/xenserver/

If management server is installed on Ubuntu, then put vhd-util into:
/usr/lib/cloud/common/scripts/vm/hypervisor/xenserver/vhd-util

Once, you've successfully installed Apache CloudStack you may read the user manuals
and guides which contains technical documentation for Apache CloudStack.
