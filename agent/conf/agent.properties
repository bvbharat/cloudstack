# Sample configuration file for CloudStack agent

# The GUID to identify the agent with, this is mandatory!
# Generate with "uuidgen"
guid=

#resource= the java class, which agent load to execute
resource=com.cloud.hypervisor.kvm.resource.LibvirtComputingResource

#workers= number of threads running in agent
workers=5

#host= The IP address of management server
host=localhost

#port = The port management server listening on, default is 8250
port=8250

#cluster= The cluster which the agent belongs to
cluster=default

#pod= The pod which the agent belongs to
pod=default

#zone= The zone which the agent belongs to
zone=default

#public.network.device= the public nic device
# if this is commented, it is autodetected on service startup
# public.network.device=cloudbr0

#private.network.device= the private nic device
# if this is commented, it is autodetected on service startup
# private.network.device=cloudbr1

#guest.network.device= the guest nic device
# if this is commented, the private nic device will be used

# local storage path, by default, it's /var/lib/libvirt/images/
#local.storage.path=/var/lib/libvirt/images/

# The UUID for the local storage pool, this is mandatory!
# Generate with "uuidgen"
local.storage.uuid=

# Location for KVM scripts
domr.scripts.dir=scripts/network/domr/kvm

# the timeout for time-consuming operations, such as create/copy snapshot
#cmds.timeout=7200

# set the vm migrate speed, by default, it will try to guess the speed of the guest network
# In MegaBytes per second
#vm.migrate.speed=0

# set the type of bridge used on the hypervisor, this defines what commands the resource 
# will use to setup networking. Currently supported NATIVE, OPENVSWITCH
#network.bridge.type=native

# set the driver used to plug and unplug nics from the bridges
# a sensible default will be selected based on the network.bridge.type but can
# be overridden here.
# native = com.cloud.hypervisor.kvm.resource.BridgeVifDriver
# openvswitch = com.cloud.hypervisor.kvm.resource.OvsBridgeDriver
