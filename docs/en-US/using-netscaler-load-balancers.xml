    <title>About Using a NetScaler Load Balancer</title>
    <para>Citrix NetScaler is supported as an external network element for load balancing in zones that use advanced networking (also called advanced zones). Set up an external load balancer when you want to provide load balancing through means other than &PRODUCT;’s provided virtual router.</para>
    <para>The NetScaler can be set up in direct (outside the firewall) mode. It must be added before any load balancing rules are deployed on guest VMs in the zone.</para>
    <para>The functional behavior of the NetScaler with &PRODUCT; is the same as described in the &PRODUCT; documentation for using an F5 external load balancer. The only exception is that the F5 supports routing domains, and NetScaler does not. NetScaler can not yet be used as a firewall.</para>
    <para>The Citrix NetScaler comes in three varieties. The following table summarizes how these variants are treated in &PRODUCT;.</para>

Provisioned instances are added into &PRODUCT; automatically – no manual configuration by the administrator is required.
