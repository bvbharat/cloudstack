    <title>DevCloud Usage Mode</title>
    <para>DevCloud can be used in several different ways:</para>
    <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>Full sandbox. Where &PRODUCT; is run within the DevCloud instance started in Virtual Box.</para>
            <para>In this mode, the &PRODUCT; management server runs within the instance and nested virtualization allows instantiation of tiny VMs within DevCloud itself. &PRODUCT; code modifications are done within DevCloud.</para>
            <para>The following diagram shows the architecture of the SandBox mode.</para>

        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>A deployment environment. Where &PRODUCT; code is developed in the localhost of the developer and the resulting build is deployed within DevCloud</para>
           <para>This mode was used in the testing procedure of &PRODUCT; 4.0.0 incubating release. See the following screencast to see how: <ulink url="http://vimeo.com/54621457">http://vimeo.com/54621457</ulink></para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>A host-only mode. Where DevCloud is used only as a host. &PRODUCT; management server is run in the localhost of the developer</para>
            <para>This mode makes use of a host-only interface defined in the Virtual Box preferences. Check the following screencast to see how: <ulink url="http://vimeo.com/54610161">http://vimeo.com/54610161</ulink></para>
