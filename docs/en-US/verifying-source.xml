    <title>Verifying the downloaded release</title>
    <para>
        There are a number of mechanisms to check the authenticity and validity of a 
        downloaded release. 
    </para>
    <section id="sect-source-verify-keys">
       <title>Getting the KEYS</title>
       <para>
          To enable you to verify the GPG signature, you will need to download the 
          <ulink url="http://www.apache.org/dist/dev/incubator/cloudstack/KEYS">KEYS</ulink>
          file.
       </para>
       <para>
          You next need to import those keys, which you can do by running the following command:
          <programlisting><prompt>#</prompt> <command>gpg</command> --import KEYS</programlisting>
       </para>
    </section>
    <section id="sect-source-verify-gpg">
        <title>GPG</title>
        <para>
           The &PRODUCT; project provides a detached GPG signature of the release.
           To check the signature, run the following command:
           <programlisting><prompt>$</prompt> <command>gpg</command> --verify apache-cloudstack-4.0.0-incubating-src.tar.bz2.asc</programlisting>
        </para>
        <para>
           If the signature is valid you will see a line of output that contains 'Good signature'.
        </para>  
    </section>
    <section id="sect-source-verify-md5">
        <title>MD5</title>
        <para>
            In addition to the cryptographic signature, &PRODUCT; has an MD5 checksum
            that you can use to verify the download matches the release. 
           You can verify this hash by executing the following command:
           <programlisting><prompt>$</prompt> <command>gpg</command> --print-md MD5 apache-cloudstack-4.0.0-incubating-src.tar.bz2 | <command>diff</command> - apache-cloudstack-4.0.0-incubating-src.tar.bz2.md5</programlisting>
         </para>
         <para>
             If this successfully completes you should see no output. If there is any output from them,
             then there is a difference between the hash you generated locally and the hash that has been
             pulled from the server.
         </para>
     </section>
     <section id="sect-source-verify-sha512">
        <title>SHA512</title>
        <para>
           In addition to the MD5 hash, the &PRODUCT; project provides a SHA512
           cryptographic hash to aid in assurance of the validity of the downloaded
           release. You can verify this hash by executing the following command:
           <programlisting><prompt>$</prompt> <command>gpg</command> --print-md SHA512 apache-cloudstack-4.0.0-incubating-src.tar.bz2 | <command>diff</command> - apache-cloudstack-4.0.0-incubating-src.tar.bz2.sha</programlisting>
        </para>
        <para>
           If this command successfully completes you should see no output. If there is any output from them,
           then there is a difference between the hash you generated locally and the hash that has been
           pulled from the server.
