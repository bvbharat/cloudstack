    <title>Building RPMs</title>
    <para>
       While we have defined, and you have presumably already installed the
       bootstrap prerequisites, there are a number of build time prerequisites
       that need to be resolved. &PRODUCT; uses maven for dependency resolution.
       You can resolve the buildtime depdencies for CloudStack by running the
       following command:
       <programlisting><prompt>$</prompt> <command>mvn</command> -P deps</programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
       Now that we have resolved the dependencies we can move on to building &PRODUCT;
       and packaging them into RPMs by issuing the following command. 
       <programlisting><prompt>$</prompt> <command>./waf</command> rpm</programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
       Once this completes, you should find assembled RPMs in
       <filename>artifacts/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64</filename>
    </para>
    <section id="sect-source-buildrpm-repo">
       <title>Creating a yum repo</title>
       <para>
          While RPMs is an ideal packaging format - it's most easily consumed from 
          yum repositories over a network. We'll move into the directory with the
          newly created RPMs by issuing the following command: 
          <programlisting><prompt>$</prompt> <command>cd</command> artifacts/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64</programlisting>
       </para>
       <para>
          Next we'll issue a command to create the repository metadata by
          issuing the following command: 
          <programlisting><prompt>$</prompt> <command>createrepo</command> ./</programlisting>
       </para>
       <para>
          The files and directories within our current working directory can now
          be uploaded to a web server and serve as a yum repository
       </para>
    </section>
    <section id="sect-source-buildrpm-repo2">
       <title>Configuring your systems to use your new yum repository</title>
       <para>
          Now that your yum repository is populated with RPMs and metadata
          we need to configure our machines that need to install CloudStack.
          We will create a file at <filename>/etc/yum.repos.d/cloudstack.repo</filename>
          with the following content: 
<programlisting>
[apache-cloudstack]
name=Apache CloudStack
baseurl=http://<replaceable>webserver.tld/path/to/repo</replaceable>
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
</programlisting>
      </para>
      <para>
         Completing this step will allow you to easily install CloudStack on a number of 
         machines across the network. 
      </para>
