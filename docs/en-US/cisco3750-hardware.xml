  <para>The following steps show how a Cisco 3750 is configured for zone-level layer-3 switching.
    These steps assume VLAN 201 is used to route untagged private IPs for pod 1, and pod 1â€™s layer-2
    switch is connected to GigabitEthernet1/0/1.</para>

    <listitem>
      <para>Setting VTP mode to transparent allows us to utilize VLAN IDs above 1000. Since we only
        use VLANs up to 999, vtp transparent mode is not strictly required.</para>
