    <title>Configure the network using OpenVswitch</title>
    <warning><para>This is a very important section, please make sure you read this thoroughly.</para></warning>
    <para>In order to forward traffic to your instances you will need at least two bridges: <emphasis>public</emphasis> and <emphasis>private</emphasis>.</para>
    <para>By default these bridges are called <emphasis>cloudbr0</emphasis> and <emphasis>cloudbr1</emphasis>, but you do have to make sure they are available on each hypervisor.</para>
    <para>The most important factor is that you keep the configuration consistent on all your hypervisors.</para>
    <section id="hypervisor-host-install-network-openvswitch-prepare">
        <title>Preparing</title>
        <para>To make sure that the native bridge module will not interfere with openvswitch the bridge module should be added to the blacklist. See the modprobe documentation for your distribution on where to find the blacklist. Make sure the module is not loaded either by rebooting or executing rmmod bridge before executing next steps.</para>
        <para>The network configurations below depend on the ifup-ovs and ifdown-ovs scripts which are part of the openvswitch installation. They should be installed in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/</para>

    <section id="hypervisor-host-install-network-openvswitch-vlan">
        <title>Network example</title>
        <para>There are many ways to configure your network. In the Basic networking mode you should have two (V)LAN's, one for your private network and one for the public network.</para>
        <para>We assume that the hypervisor has one NIC (eth0) with three tagged VLAN's:</para>

            <listitem><para>VLAN 300 for private network of the instances (cloudbr1)</para></listitem>
        </orderedlist>
        <para>On VLAN 100 we give the Hypervisor the IP-Address 192.168.42.11/24 with the gateway 192.168.42.1</para>

            examples for RHEL/CentOS.</para>
        <note><para>The goal is to have three bridges called 'mgmt0', 'cloudbr0' and 'cloudbr1' after this
                section. This should be used as a guideline only. The exact configuration will
                depend on your network layout.</para></note>
