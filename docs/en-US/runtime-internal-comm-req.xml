      <para>The Management Servers communicate with each other to coordinate tasks. This
        communication uses TCP on ports 8250 and 9090.</para>

      <para>The console proxy VMs connect to all hosts in the zone over the management traffic
        network. Therefore the management traffic network of any given pod in the zone must have
        connectivity to the management traffic network of all other pods in the zone.</para>

    <listitem>
      <para>The secondary storage VMs and console proxy VMs connect to the Management Server on
        port 8250. If you are using multiple Management Servers, the load balanced IP address of the
        Management Servers on port 8250 must be reachable.</para>
