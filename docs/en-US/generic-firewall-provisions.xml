  <title>Generic Firewall Provisions</title>
  <para>The hardware firewall is required to serve two purposes:</para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>Protect the Management Servers. NAT and port forwarding should be configured to direct
        traffic from the public Internet to the Management Servers.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Route management network traffic between multiple zones. Site-to-site VPN should be
        configured between multiple zones.</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <para>To achieve the above purposes you must set up fixed configurations for the firewall.
    Firewall rules and policies need not change as users are provisioned into the cloud. Any brand
    of hardware firewall that supports NAT and site-to-site VPN can be used.</para>
