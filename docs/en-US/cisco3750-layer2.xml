  <title>Cisco 3750</title>
  <para>The following steps show how a Cisco 3750 is configured for pod-level layer-2
    switching.</para>
  <orderedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>Setting VTP mode to transparent allows us to utilize VLAN IDs above 1000. Since we only
        use VLANs up to 999, vtp transparent mode is not strictly required.</para>
      <programlisting>vtp mode transparent
vlan 300-999
exit</programlisting>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Configure all ports to dot1q and set 201 as the native VLAN.</para>
      <programlisting>interface range GigabitEthernet 1/0/1-24
switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
switchport mode trunk
switchport trunk native vlan 201
exit</programlisting>
    </listitem>
  </orderedlist>
  <para>By default, Cisco passes all VLANs. Cisco switches complain of the native VLAN IDs are
    different when 2 ports are connected together. Thatâ€™s why you must specify VLAN 201 as the
    native VLAN on the layer-2 switch.</para>
