    <title>Install and Configure libvirt</title>
    <para>&PRODUCT; uses libvirt for managing virtual machines. Therefore it is vital that libvirt is configured correctly. Libvirt is a dependency of cloud-agent and should already be installed.</para>

        <listitem>
            <para>In order to have live migration working libvirt has to listen for unsecured TCP connections. We also need to turn off libvirts attempt to use Multicast DNS advertising. Both of these settings are in <filename>/etc/libvirt/libvirtd.conf</filename></para>
            <para>Set the following paramaters:</para>
            <programlisting>listen_tls = 0</programlisting>

            <para>Turning on "listen_tcp" in libvirtd.conf is not enough, we have to change the parameters as well:</para>
            <para>On RHEL or CentOS modify <filename>/etc/sysconfig/libvirtd</filename>:</para>
            <para>Uncomment the following line:</para>
