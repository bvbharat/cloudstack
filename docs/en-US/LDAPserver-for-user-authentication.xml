<section id="LDAPserver-for-user-authentication">
    <title>Using an LDAP Server for User Authentication</title>
    <para>You can use an external LDAP server such as Microsoft Active Directory or ApacheDS to authenticate &PRODUCT; end-users. Just map &PRODUCT; accounts to the corresponding LDAP accounts using a query filter. The query filter is written using the query syntax of the particular LDAP server, and can include special wildcard characters provided by &PRODUCT; for matching common values such as the userâ€™s email address and name. &PRODUCT; will search the external LDAP directory tree starting at a specified base directory and return the distinguished name (DN) and password of the matching user. This information along with the given password is used to authenticate the user..</para>
    <para>To set up LDAP authentication in &PRODUCT;, call the &PRODUCT; API command ldapConfig and provide the following:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>Hostname or IP address and listening port of the LDAP server</para></listitem>
        <listitem> <para>Base directory and query filter</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Search user DN credentials, which give &PRODUCT; permission to search on the LDAP server</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>SSL keystore and password, if SSL is used</para></listitem>     
    </itemizedlist>
