  <title>Setting Up a Site-to-Site VPN Connection</title>
  <para>A Site-to-Site VPN connection helps you establish a secure connection from an enterprise
    datacenter to the cloud infrastructure. This allows users to access the guest VMs by
    establishing a VPN connection to the virtual router of the account from a device in the
    datacenter of the enterprise. Having this facility eliminates the need to establish VPN
    connections to individual VMs.</para>
  <para>The supported endpoints on the remote datacenters are: </para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>Cisco ISR with IOS 12.4 or later</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Juniper J-Series routers with JunOS 9.5 or later</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <note>
    <para>In addition to the specific Cisco and Juniper devices listed above, the expectation is
      that any Cisco or Juniper device running on the supported operating systems are able to
      establish VPN connections.</para>
  </note>
