  <title>Amazon Web Services Compatible Interface</title>
    <para>&PRODUCT; can translate Amazon Web Services (AWS) API calls to native &PRODUCT; API calls
    so that users can continue using existing AWS-compatible tools. This translation service runs as
    a separate web application in the same tomcat server as the management server of &PRODUCT;,
    listening on a different port. The Amazon Web Services (AWS) compatible interface provides the
    EC2 SOAP and Query APIs as well as the S3 REST API.</para> 
    <note>
      <para>This service was previously enabled by separate software called CloudBridge. It is now
      fully integrated with the &PRODUCT; management server. </para>
    </note>
    <warning>
      <para>The compatible interface for the EC2 Query API and the S3 API are Work In Progress. The S3 compatible API offers a way to store data on the management server file system, it is not an implementation of the S3 backend.</para>
